Analysis for the past ten years of USD 229 school district budgets (2014-2023) downloaded as pdf files from Kansas State Department of Education https://datacentral.ksde.org/budget.aspx

I extracted the data in the table in each pdf (each file holds three years of budget data) and converted it into a csv file using the camelot library. I notice this only extracted data from the first table in the pdf.

Using pandas, I combined the three csv files into a single file.
